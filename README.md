# City-Level Work Service Directory for India

## Summary
This project aims to provide a city-level work service directory for India, unlike other popular websites like Clutch, GoodFirms, and DesignRush, which offer services based on regions or states. Our website consolidates services available in various cities across India, offering a more granular and accessible platform for consumers.

## Scraping
To gather the necessary data, we utilized Python and Selenium. We employed the Tor Browser to bypass Cloudflare protections, allowing us to avoid the costs associated with proxy servers.

## Website
The website is built using WordPress to host the aggregated data for consumers. This provides a user-friendly interface for users to access city-level work services.
