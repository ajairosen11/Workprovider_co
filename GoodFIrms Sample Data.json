We are Microsoft Gold Certified for software development as well as technical support services, a Salesforce.com Consulting Partner and Standard Consulting Partner with Amazon Web Services (AWS). That means that dealing with us is not like dealing with freelance developers or smaller, less mature companies. We consistently deliver quality deliverables on time and to the customer's satisfaction. We are based in India, the US and the UK. Aress Software, established in 1999, is now a 600 people company. Our 25,000 Sq. Ft. development centre is based in Nasik in India, a city of around 1.2 million people some 125 miles north of Mumbai (previously known as Bombay). Being away from the main conurbations of India, costs are somewhat lower and we are happy to pass this cost advantage on to our clients.We have all the credentials to do what we do and do it well. We will never have any problems getting customer references. Their praise is almost embarrassing sometimes. Still we strive to get better all the time. Our experience means we know what we are talking about. In the odd case we may not, you can be sure we\u2019ll tell you. We are flexible and easy to work with and have a western presence to talk to whenever you feel the need.Certifications",
